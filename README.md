# Question Answering
This repo is complimentary to the one(s) created during the FF1 project. This repo modifies the code in those repositories to make them more user friendly for use on the Cloudera CDSW/CML platforms


## Set up
-- install requirements.txt (once I make one)
-- add qa package to requirements.txt


## Weird stuff
* training / eval on CDSW yields drastically different results than when trained in Colab notebook
We're talking 10% difference in model performance between the two. Need to dig into this.
